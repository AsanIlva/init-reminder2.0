//Todo in HTML => div that will hold the time table, A div or header that shows the current day
//JavaScript has a DateObject() built in
//Input fields inside the div for the eight hours in the day

//When the page loads, check local storage,
//if appointments exists, load it into the corresponding time slot

//I'll need a function to capture the user input and saving it in local storage
//each input field will need it's own save button

//I'll need way to track the current day and time.  

//A formula that will color code an hour that has passed

//A conditional statment.
// if the div id is greater than or equal to the time style background color green else color grey
// do this in a loop

// get the element that the info goes into

// decide on what it should look like
// and then update it...
// should this run in a loop and update the clock reguraly?
// create timeblocks with inputs and buttons
// loop and dynamically or I could hard code it.
// add events to the submit button to save what is in the
//     input to local storage
//  get the value out of local storage and populate
//     the input with the data
// check to see what the color of the input should be based on the time
//      moment?
// look at the css for classes later for this
// store data in localstrage as an object where the key is the hour of the day...
